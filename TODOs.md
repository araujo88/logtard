# TODOs

1. **Implement File Logger**
   - Design and implement a logger that outputs log messages to a file.

2. **Thread Safety**
   - Ensure that logging operations are thread-safe to support multi-threaded applications.

3. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Establish benchmarks to measure the performance impact of logging operations, particularly in high-throughput scenarios.

4. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests covering the core functionalities of the library, including each log level and logger type.

### Feature Enhancements

5. **Log Rotation**
   - Implement log rotation for file loggers to manage log file sizes and facilitate log maintenance.

6. **Custom Format Support**
   - Allow users to define custom log message formats, including specifying timestamp formats and including/excluding elements like file name and line number.

7. **Asynchronous Logging**
   - Develop an asynchronous logging mechanism to reduce the impact on application performance.

8. **Support for Structured Logging**
   - Add support for structured logging, enabling logging in formats like JSON for better integration with log management and analysis tools.

### Documentation and Examples

9. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Create detailed documentation covering all aspects of the library, including setup, usage examples, extending the library, and API reference.

10. **Advanced Usage Examples**
    - Provide examples of advanced usage, such as creating custom loggers, integrating with third-party services, and configuring log rotation.

### Community and Contribution

11. **Contribution Guidelines**
    - Draft clear contribution guidelines to encourage and facilitate contributions from the open-source community.

12. **Issue Templates and Labels**
    - Set up issue templates and labels on GitHub to streamline issue reporting and categorization.

13. **CI/CD Pipeline**
    - Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate testing and ensure code quality for contributions.

### Long-term Improvements

14. **Cross-platform Compatibility**
    - Ensure the library is fully compatible across different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and compilers.

15. **Localization and Internationalization**
    - Add support for multi-language log messages and documentation to cater to a global user base.

16. **User Feedback Loop**
    - Establish a mechanism for collecting user feedback to guide future development priorities and enhancements.

17. **Community Engagement**
    - Plan and implement ways to engage with the user community, such as hosting Q&A sessions, participating in relevant forums, and presenting at conferences.
